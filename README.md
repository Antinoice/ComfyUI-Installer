ComfyUI web interface installer
https://youtu.be/ln6g5SxKztQ
The installer downloads and unpacks ComfyUI to the disk you select (you will be asked during the installation process), installs dependencies for operation, as well as the manager, and everything is automatic.

Recommendations:
1. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
2. After installation, run the files:
a. ...\ComfyUI_windows_portable\update\update_comfyui.bat
b. ...\ComfyUI_windows_portable\update\update_comfyui_and_python_dependencies.bat
3. Create an icon on the desktop from the file (optional):
...\ComfyUI_windows_portable\run_nvidia_gpu.bat
Send to the desktop and create an icon in the properties by selecting the LogoForIcon.ico image
4. Run ComfyUI
5. Install custom nodes ReActor and ArtVenture using the manager
6. In the folder ...\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfyui-art-venture\web
replace the upload.js file with the downloaded one and restart the interface.
